Changes pushed to this subrepo via integrated terminal will apply to the reactime-website repository which will in turn update reacti.me(if in main branch) - to pull changes, be sure that you are within reactime-website subrepo, then git pull origin 'main', or whatever branch you are trying to pull from.

1. When a change is pushed to 'main' branch of reactime-website subrepo, app will automatically re-build and deploy via GitHub actions (double check you are inside an integrated terminal for reactime-website subrepository when pushing)
2. To check build progress or errors- Go to 'Actions' tab on reactime-website GitHub repo and from there you can view workflows and build progress/history
